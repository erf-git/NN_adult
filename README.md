# NN_classification_adult
Objective: create a neural network application for UCI's Adult dataset and improve the accuracy of baseline models UCI (Accuracy: 78-88%, Precision: 74-89%). Includes PyTorch proficiency, optimization with Optuna, and feature engineering.

DATASET: UCI Adult (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)

Resulting:
- Two linear layer networks created with a dropout and a relu layer, diminishing returns with 3 or more layers
- Gained experience in hyperparameter tuning NN models with Optuna
- Optimized F1 to 84%, AUC to 91%, Precision to 71%, and Recall to 79% (<0.01 margin of error for all)

Areas for Improvement:
- Additional feature engineering could result in higher Precision like in the baseline models described in UCI
- Different convolution layers and model structures could be explored
- Make figures!
